#TYPES
---


###INTEGERS
  - Python represents integers using the immutable int type. 
  - For immutable objects there is no difference between a variable and an object reference.
  - The size of Python's integers limited by machine memory
  

###FLOATS
  - Numbers with a fractional part are represented by the immutable type *float*.
  - Single precision: a 32-bit float is represented by: 1 bit for sign (negative being 1, positive being 0), plus 23 bits for the significant digits (or mantissa), plus 8 bits for the exponent
  

###COMPLEX NUMBERS
  - A complex data type is an immutable number that holds a pair of floats
    - example, z = 3 + 4j
    - Examples:
      - z.real
      - z.imag
      - z.conjugate()
  - Imported from **cmath** module
    - Examples:
      - cmath.phase()
      - cmath.polar()
      - cmath.rect()
      - cmath.pi
      - cmath.e
